Whenever using ML:

    1) Design the model (the forward pass), the input size and output size
    2) Construct loss and the optimiser
    3) Training loop
         - Forward pass: Compute prediction
         - Backward pass: Gradients
         - Compute loss for accuracy check
         - Update weights
